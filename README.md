### B550M-EFI

# B550M EFI File for MacOS Sonoma 14.6.1 - Opencore

This is my first version of the necessary files to make the ASRock B550M Steel Legend motherboard work with OpenCore 1.0.1 and macOS Sonoma 14.6.1.

## What's included in this file?

I have included in this zip file the necessary `config.plist` and kexts to make this motherboard run macOS with OpenCore. USB ports are mapped, and I have also added three `.aml` files in the ACPI folder to fix the restart/shutdown problem.
This description will be updated soon, and I will add a list of the kexts and fixes that I included.

## Description of `config.plist` changes

This section will contain a list of all changes made in the `config.plist`, including the AMD Vanilla Patch.

## Description of kext files

This section shows a list of all kexts used in the EFI folder, along with links to their GitHub repositories.
